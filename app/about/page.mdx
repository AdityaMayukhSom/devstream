### A Brief About Me

Hey! I'm Aditya Mayukh Som, a final-year B.Engg student from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. When I'm not trying to finish the syllabus of semester exams, you'll find me knee-deep in code, building full-stack applications, or geeking out over DSA, DevOps and highly scalable infrastructure. Friends call me a huge nerd, but I like to call myself a guitarist.

I recently completed my internship as an `Intern Analyst` at Wells Fargo, tinkering with Machine Learning technologies (in `Python`, but no, not the slithery kind) for financial analysis. Turns out, the biggest takaways from the internship were not the technological skills, but team bonding, corporate culture and of course, the ancient art of meeting project deadlines.

Last year when I was a sophomore, I interned at a Singapore based startup Betr Beta, helping build their platform with `Next.js` and `GPT-4`. In my freshman year, I interned at another AI driven startup named Writee as a front-end developmer where I ended up learning `Pug`, `Express` and `TailwindCSS`.

Apart from the time spent with my dear laptop, I try to capture the world through my camera lens. I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AdityaMayukhSom) where I spill the beans on secrets of the universe. If that piques your interest, do check it out!

I'm stoked about the future and can't wait to forge new paths in web development and beyond. Let's make the web a more amazing place, one line of code at a time!
